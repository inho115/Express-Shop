- Purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of crucial conecept in web developement and they are:
  - Server-side logic
  - MVC framework
  - CRUD operation
  - Authentication
  - Validation
  - Authorization
  - Session

## Description 
- When a visitor is not logged in, available action are limited to viewing existing products.
![LoggedIn](https://github.com/inho115/Express-Shop/assets/97544886/712a6448-d7d4-4791-a4ca-306eb0baa644)

- If a user is not authenticated (not logged in or does not exist), an authentication middleware will check a status of a session. 
- As a next step, server redirects a user to either login page or correct page.
- An authentication middleware is applied to most of CRUD operations, and it prevents a malicious user from entering url manually to perform unallowed actions.

- Once sign up process is complete, a user will receive an email from test@inhohan.ca with a welcoming message.
- Seng Grid API was implemented for this purpose but also for resetting a password.
- Signed up user's information will be saved to a mongoDb Atlas database, and will be used to authenticate and authorize user.
![signup email](https://github.com/inho115/Express-Shop/assets/97544886/19a8fe60-886c-45c8-b7d9-85b2afbdd993)

- If a user click a reset password link, a single line form will be rendered. 
- When form is submitted, encrypted token is created for the user and it will be used for resetting process.
- The user will receive an email generated by Send Grid, which contains token as a paramter.
![Reset password link](https://github.com/inho115/Express-Shop/assets/97544886/734f55a2-448b-44a2-8ff3-fac6c1a09f2f)

- This link will lead a user to reach a route where it utilize the parameter for validation/authentication process.
- If a verification with a reset token is complete, the user can enter new password and server will redirect user to a login page.
![new password input](https://github.com/inho115/Express-Shop/assets/97544886/f95d020f-e009-4faa-a071-74aa65222d2d)

- To add product, the user will be asked to input title, image file, price, and description of the product.
- For an image, the image will be stored in server's images folder and deleted after image is uploaded to cloudinary server.
- Once upload is complete, the server will fetch url of image and store the url instead of path of the image.
- This process was implemented to reduce the number of static file in server for optimization purpose.
![add product page](https://github.com/inho115/Express-Shop/assets/97544886/2ae10712-2929-415c-bef1-cc1416bca313)

- On Admin page, the user can either update or delete product.
- Editing is simple, unless user is updating the image file.
- If new image is updated, the same process that occured in adding stage will happen once again.
- For deletion, server will request Cloudinary to delete the file by sending filename as a parameter.
- The server is deleting Cloudinary data first since database holds the name of the file.
- After that the server will find the product with same id in mongoDB database and delete it.
